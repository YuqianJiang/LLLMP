I have a knowledge graph that represents a household. A state change in the household
is provided below. A set of relevant relations in the knowledge graph is also provided.
Based on the state change, determine which of the relations should be removed and what
new relations should be added. Only add and remove relations that are strictly necessary
for the state update. Do not assume anything extra about the description. Each update
must appear in a triplet form.

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
```
{{{{{{{{
    "REMOVE": [list of relations to remove],
    "ADD": [list of relations to add]
}}}}}}}}
```

Here is the list of allowed relation types: {predicate_names}
Here is the list of entities: {entity_names}

Here is an example:
```
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: I picked up Brenda's phone.
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
brenda_phone -> placed_at_shelf -> patrick_bedroom_shelf
brenda_phone -> on_shelf_level -> level_8
brenda_phone -> instance_of -> phone
patrick_bedroom -> has -> patrick_bedroom_shelf
patrick_bedroom_shelf -> in_room -> patrick_bedroom
patrick_bedroom_shelf -> instance_of -> shelf
patrick_bedroom -> instance_of -> bedroom
patrick_bedroom -> has -> patrick_bedroom_shelf
patrick_bedroom_shelf -> in_room -> patrick_bedroom
---------------------
{{{{{{{{
    "REMOVE": [
        "brenda_phone -> contained_by_shelf -> patrick_bedroom_shelf",
        "brenda_phone -> on_shelf_level -> shelf_level_8"
    ],
    "ADD": [
        "brenda_phone -> in_hand -> me"
    ]
}}}}}}}}
```

Here is the real problem:
---------------------
STATE CHANGE: {{state_change}}
---------------------
RELEVANT RELATIONS:
{{{{filtered_triplet_str}}}}
---------------------
